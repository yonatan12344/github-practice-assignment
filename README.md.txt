Title #Github Practice for Biostats Lab 1 "Practice with learning github push pull commit, and branches"
# Goals within this class
My goals with this class are to learn version control, build out a couple of projects on github, and 
learn about new kinds of computational research.
# Why reproducibaility is important
1. It gives me a job, since im a bioinformatcian who doesn't want to do experimental work, and need
   to find data to work with online, which reprodcible studies often provide.
2. Reproducible data, makes it easier to catch fraud
3. Reproducible data, makes it easier to understand how people came to the conclusions they did.
